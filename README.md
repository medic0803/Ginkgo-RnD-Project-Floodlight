# Ginkgo Floodlight OpenFlow Controller


<a id="orgb64190f"></a>

## What is this Project?

This is a research and development project, which is aims to implement an Application of Software Defined Network Technology in Campus Area Level Multimedia Service Guarantee, the controller is developed by team Ginkgo based on Floodlight.

## What is OpenFlow?

OpenFlow is a open standard managed by Open Networking Foundation. It specifies a protocol by which a remote controller can modify the behavior of networking devices through a well-defined “forwarding instruction set”. Floodlight is designed to work with the growing number of switches, routers, virtual switches, and access points that support the OpenFlow standard.

### 1. Recommendation way

Clone this project to an IDEA project and let your idea to help you to finish the rest of dirty works

## Future works

We believe that the openflow especially the Floodlight controller may not be so popular in the future, but if you want to contribute to this project or have any difficulties while developing similar floodlight project, we are welcome to the questions via issues, E-mail, just because it is also a hard time for us with poor information support during the development.

We also list some functional features we do not complete:

1.  QoS routing monitor module
2.  Using algorithm to upgrade the precision and refine the Floodlight's cost of system resources.
3.  Figure out the way of measure the pack loss in the virtual enironment mininet.
4.  Change the Source-based tree to Shared tree.
5.  Web page controller controls the user groups
6.  Security policy module
7.  Implement multiple network segements and connect to the internet in the experimental topology
8.  Implement the controller to real campus network environment
