What is Floodlight?
-------------------

Floodlight is the leading open source OpenFlow controller. It is [supported by a community of developers](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller/Authors+and+Contributors), including a number of engineers from [Big Switch Networks](http://www.bigswitch.com/).

What is OpenFlow?
-----------------

OpenFlow is a open standard managed by Open Networking Foundation. It specifies a protocol by which a remote controller can modify the behavior of networking devices through a well-defined “forwarding instruction set”. Floodlight is designed to work with the growing number of switches, routers, virtual switches, and access points that support the OpenFlow standard.

Getting Started
---------------

The quickest way to use Floodlight is to start with our [pre-built VM](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/8650780/Floodlight+VM), which includes the controller, IDE, and everything you need to use Floodlight and/or start developing. You can also deploy and develop with Floodlight [in your own environment](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/1343544/Installation+Guide).

If you are a developer and are looking for project ideas, please take a look at [our current issues](https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight/issues). They are a great way to get started developing with Floodlight and provide a concrete way in which to [give back](#Contribution)!
